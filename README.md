## My process

Started with making an html file for the project. Created a css file afterwards and connected them, using the link attribute.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

I learnt alot while doing this project. Ranging from div containers in my html, to media queries in my css.

```css
@media (max-width: 461px) {
  .container {
    padding-left: 80px;
    padding-right: 90px;
    margin-top: 170px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on perfecting my css, I am currently no where close to my dreams, but I know I would get there!
